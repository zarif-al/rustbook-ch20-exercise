# Multithreaded Web Server Exercise

This repository is my attemp at the multithreaded web server exercise in the rust book. While implementing I will make some changes to implementation in the hopes of making it better. (**Note:** The intent of this exercise is to practice multithreading and **not** to create a robust web server.)

This project is `Dockerized`.
